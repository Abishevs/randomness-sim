# simulation crate for generating large samples of diffrent shuffling algorithms
This beatifull project is an complementary to randomness test that will be implemented in python using
numpy and matplotlib for visualisation. While this for generating raw binnary 1d lists of large datasets.
utilising rusts rayon crate for paralliziton and running on multiple threads, and benefits of low-level access 
with high level abstractions. 

## This is just an part of bigger ongoing project!!!
